AS A DATABASE ADMINISTRATOR FOR A UNIVERSITY, YOU NEED TO CREATE AN APPLICATION TO MANAGE STUDENT ENROLLMENTS AND BALANCE.

The application has to do the following

Ask the user how many new students will be added
The user should be prompted to enter name and year for each student
The student should have a 5-digit unique ID, with the first number being their grade level.
Each course costs $600 to enroll
The student should be able to view their balance and pay the tuition.
To see the student status, we should see their name, ID, courses enrolled and balance.
